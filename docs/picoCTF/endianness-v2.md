!!! abstract "Description"
    Here's a file that was recovered from a 32-bits system that organized the bytes a weird way. We're not even sure what type of file it is. Download it [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c_titan/115/challengefile) and see what you can get out of it

You get a strange file with some gibberish data extracted by `strings` command. Maybe some steganography involved?

Ha ha. No. ðŸ™„
